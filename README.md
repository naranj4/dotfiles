# Dotfiles

## Installation Script (DEPRECATED)

I no longer use most of the installation scripts besides `link.sh` for symlinking my dotfiles.
Eventually, I would like to revisit this, but not now.

## Neovim

## ZSH

## Vim (DEPRECATED)

I moved off using my `.vimrc` permanently now that I fully transitioned to using `neovim`.
